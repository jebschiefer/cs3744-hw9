CS 3744 - Homework 9
==========

A modified version of the Homework 9 assignment for CS 3744 at Virginia Tech during Fall Semester 2013.

An input string is declared in `/res/strings.xml`. A button is created for each word in the string. Beneath the buttons is the OpenGL SurfaceView with blue rectagles. The size of the rectangles corresponds to the length of the word. Tapping a button will turn the corresponding rectangle red. 

This is an Android application that makes use of OpenGL ES 2.0. It is recommended that Android Studio is used for this project.

Last built using:
- Android Studio 0.8.6
- JDK 1.7.0_67
